### Introduction

Congratulations. You're starting a new tech company.

The first thing we must do, if you are going to garner the attention of wealthy
investors, is to devise your [elevator pitch](https://fi.co/madlibs).

Luckily, you have a few JavaScript tricks up your sleeve to assist with this
task.


### Getting Started

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges       # for Mac/Linux
$ cd %HOME%/challenges  # for Windows
$ et get startup-mad-libs
```

Open the `startup-mad-libs` project folder in your editor.

Open the `startup-mad-libs/index.html` file in your browser.

In the browser, open up the JavaScript console. You will be saving your
code in `main.js`. Then, you can refresh the page in order to see your changes.


### Instructions

Use your JavaScript string concatenation skills, and the variables provided,
build your **One-Sentence Elevator Pitch** and print it to the JavaScript
console.

Your pitch should follow this format:

```no_highlight
My company, [companyName],
is developing [anOffering]
to help [aTargetAudience]
[solveAProblem]
[secretSauce].
```

Feel free to change the variables defined in `main.js` to describe your Startup.

{% show_hint %}
Remember, we can use string concatenation to build new strings.

```javascript
let companyName = "Tesla Motors";
let firstLine = "My company, " + companyName;
```
{% endshow_hint %}


### Submitting Your Code

Once you have completed this exercise, use the `et` command to submit your code
from this project's folder.

```no-highlight
$ cd ~/challenges/startup-mad-libs       # for Mac/Linux
$ cd %HOME%/challenges/startup-mad-libs  # for Windows
$ et submit
```
