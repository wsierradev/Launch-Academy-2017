You've been tasked with making a quiz application in React!

![React Quiz 1][react-quiz-1]

## Setup
From your challenges directory, run the following:

```
$ et get react-quiz
$ cd react-quiz
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec ruby server.rb -o 0.0.0.0
```

Then in another terminal tab run:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

If you go to [localhost:4567][localhost-4567], there will be nothing on the
page except React Quiz and there should be no errors in your console.

**Reminder:** Please be sure to **refresh** your browser for changes to take effect, since we are not using `webpack-dev-server` the way we do in other assignments.

## Meets Expectations Requirements
1. Using React and the data supplied in `react/src/constants/data.js`, render a
     static page displaying the question and its possible answers. **You may not
     modify the data in this file**. On initial render, the page should not
     display either 'Correct!' or 'Incorrect' on the page.

2. Clicking on a correct answer updates the page to display 'Correct!' at the
     bottom of the answers.

3. Clicking on an incorrect answer updates the page to display 'Incorrect' at the
     bottom of the answers.

## Exceeds Expectations Requirements
1. Add an API endpoint to the Sinatra application which responds to the following cURL request:

    ```sh
    $ curl http://localhost:4567/api/questions.json
    ```

    The JSON response should be a random question with three incorrect answers
    and one correct answer. The following is an example of how the response
    body should be structured:

    ```sh
    {"question":{"id":1,"body":"What is the best JavaScript Framework?"},"answers":[{"id":1,"body":"React","question_id":1,"correct":true},{"id":2,"body":"Ember","question_id":1,"correct":false},{"id":3,"body":"Angular2","question_id":1,"correct":false},{"id":4,"body":"Rails","question_id":1,"correct":false}]};
    ```

2. Update the `questions.json` file to seed two more new questions that each have four answers to the database. **Tip:** Don't forget to open the `questions.json` file first using `File.read`.
3. Update your React application so it uses data from the API endpoint that you created rather than the data from `react/src/constants/data.js`.
4. When a correct answer is selected, your React application should now display a button with the text "Next Question".

     ![React Quiz 4][react-quiz-4]

     Clicking on the button will update the application to show a question randomly chosen from the server.
     The page should not display either 'Correct!' or 'Incorrect' on the page.

5. For Exceeds Expectations, a random question should be chosen in the server for the first question and every next question.
Try to use a ReactLifecycle method for the initial question, and define an event handler for each subsequent question.
